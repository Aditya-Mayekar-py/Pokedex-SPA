                <li><b>Description:</b> Electric-type Pokémon generate and control electricity. They are known for their high speed and often feature moves that can paralyze opponents.</li>
                <li><b>Strength:</b> Electric types are strong against Water and Flying Pokémon, as water conducts electricity, and flying types can be struck down by lightning.</li>
                <li><b>Weakness:</b> However, they are vulnerable to Ground types, as the ground neutralizes electric attacks.</li>
                <li><b>Best Starter Pokémon:</b> Pikachu, the iconic Electric-type Pokémon, evolves from Pichu and can further evolve into Raichu or Alolan Raichu.</li>
