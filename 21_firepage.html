                <li><b>Description:</b> Fire-type Pokémon embody the element of fire, often boasting fiery designs and moves. These Pokémon are known for their aggressive and powerful attacks, frequently involving flames and heat-based techniques.</li>
                <li><b>Strength:</b> Fire types are super effective against Bug, Grass, Ice, and Steel Pokémon, making them formidable in battles against these types.</li>
                <li><b>Weakness:</b> They are, however, vulnerable to Water, Rock, and Ground types, as water extinguishes fire and rock and ground can withstand heat.</li>
                <li><b>Best Starter Pokémon:</b> Charmander, with its flame-tipped tail, evolves into Charizard, a powerful Fire/Flying-type Pokémon.</li>
