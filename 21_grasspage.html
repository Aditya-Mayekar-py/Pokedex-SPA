                <li><b>Description:</b> Grass-type Pokémon are often plant-based creatures with moves related to nature, plants, and sometimes poison. They are known for their vibrant designs and supportive moves.</li>
                <li><b>Strength:</b> Grass types are effective against Water, Ground, and Rock Pokémon, using their botanical powers to overcome these types.</li>
                <li><b>Weakness:</b> They are, however, vulnerable to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug types, as fire can scorch plants, and these types can exploit weaknesses in their structure.</li>
                <li><b>Best Starter Pokémon:</b> Bulbasaur, a dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon, evolves into Ivysaur and later into Venusaur, combining the Grass type with poison capabilities.</li>
