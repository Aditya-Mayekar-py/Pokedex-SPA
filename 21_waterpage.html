                <li><b>Description:</b> Water-type Pokémon are often aquatic creatures with moves associated with water and ice. They are known for their versatility, excelling in both offense and defense.</li>
                <li><b>Strength:</b> Water types are strong against Fire, Ground, and Rock Pokémon, using their aquatic prowess to douse flames and overcome rock-based defenses.</li>
                <li><b>Weakness:</b> However, they are weak to Electric and Grass types, as electricity conducts well in water and plants absorb water for nourishment.</li>
                <li><b>Best Starter Pokémon:</b> Squirtle, a turtle-like Pokémon, evolves into Blastoise, a formidable Water-type with powerful water-based attacks.</li>
